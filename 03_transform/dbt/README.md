# nyc_taxi_dbt

A minimal dbt project transforming NYC yellow taxi trip data, using
DuckDB as the adapter so it reads parquet directly over HTTPS — no
warehouse, download, or load step needed.

This project is being built up gradually across three classes. Right
now it contains staging (Class 1) plus tests and the `fct_trips` fact
model (Class 2 scope); the rest lives in `future/` and gets folded in
as we go.

```

## Setup

1. Install: `pip install dbt-duckdb`
2. Copy `profiles.yml.example` to `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`.
3. From the `nyc_taxi_dbt/` directory:

```bash
dbt debug        # confirm the connection
dbt run          # build stg_yellow_tripdata and fct_trips
dbt test         # run column tests + the singular tests in tests/
```

4. Query the result:

```bash
duckdb nyc_taxi.duckdb -c "select * from fct_trips limit 10;"
```

No local data file to download — `sources.yml` points `external_location`
at TLC's public HTTPS parquet host, and DuckDB's `httpfs`/`parquet`
extensions stream it on demand. That same `external_location` key can
just as easily point at a local file path or an `s3://` URL — see the
comments in `sources.yml`.

## Why `{{ }}`? (Jinja + `ref()`)

The `.sql` files in `models/` aren't plain SQL — they're SQL *templates*
written in [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/), the same
templating language Flask/Django use for HTML. dbt compiles each
template into real SQL before running it.

The construct you'll see everywhere is `{{ ref('model_name') }}`, e.g.
in `fct_trips.sql`:

```sql
with trips as (
    select * from {{ ref('stg_yellow_tripdata') }}
)
```

`ref()` is a function call, not a table name — dbt resolves it at
compile time to the actual table/view in whatever database and schema
the current target points at. Two things fall out of that:

- **No hardcoded table names.** The same model compiles correctly
  whether it's running against your local `dev` target or a
  teammate's, without editing SQL.
- **Automatic lineage.** Because every `ref()` is a real, parseable
  function call, dbt can statically scan the whole `models/` directory
  and build the dependency graph from it — that's how it knows
  `fct_trips` must run after `stg_yellow_tripdata`. `sources.yml`'s
  `{{ source('raw', 'yellow_tripdata') }}` does the same thing for raw
  tables (see `stg_yellow_tripdata.sql`).

Want to see what a model actually compiles to? Run `dbt compile` and
open the matching file under `target/compiled/nyc_taxi_dbt/models/` —
`{{ ref(...) }}` will have become a literal table reference. That
side-by-side (template vs. compiled SQL) is the fastest way to get an
intuition for what Jinja is doing.

This project only uses `ref()`/`source()` — the two constructs that
cover most day-to-day dbt work. Jinja's other features (`{% if %}`,
`{% for %}`, custom macros, `{{ var(...) }}`) are worth learning once a
model actually needs them — e.g. looping over columns, or an
incremental model's `{% if is_incremental() %}` block — rather than as
syntax to memorize up front.

## Class-by-class build-up

- **Class 1:** `stg_yellow_tripdata` only — a `source()` reading raw
  parquet, cast/renamed columns, a `where` filter dropping bad rows.
  Materialized as a `view`.
- **Class 2 (current):** column tests on staging (`not_null` on
  `pickup_at`, `trip_distance_miles`) plus a singular test,
  `assert_no_zero_or_null_trips.sql`. Adds `fct_trips`
  (`models/marts/fct_trips.sql`), wired via `{{ ref() }}` to the
  staging model — introduces model lineage, derived columns
  (duration/speed/tip%), and `table` materialization. A second
  singular test, `assert_no_unrealistic_trip_speeds.sql`, checks a
  *derived* column against a business rule (no NYC taxi can plausibly
  average >100mph) — something a generic `not_null`/`unique` test
  can't express.
- **Class 3:** add `mart_daily_summary` (`future/marts/mart_daily_summary.sql`)
  for the daily-rollup aggregation layer, and its `schema.yml` tests
  (`unique` + `not_null` on the `pickup_date` grain).

## Model chain (end state, after Class 3)

`stg_yellow_tripdata` (view, cleans/casts raw parquet) →
`fct_trips` (table, adds duration/speed/tip_pct, drops bad durations) →
`mart_daily_summary` (table, daily aggregates for reporting)
